# All-Visual-Basic-6-projects

>a compilation of projects i made with no incentive other then my own self interest in programming when i was a kid


>sadly none of them are in a working state rn due to Visual Basic Basic 6 being obsolete and most of the APIS and libraries i used were not future proof
i could get them to work on a virtual machine and installing software from that time era but that would be too much trouble

>overall its just a showcase of projects ive done, full stack, 2d games , simulations, custom graphics, all that stuff
